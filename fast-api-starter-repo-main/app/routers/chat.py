Chat router — exposes the /chat endpoint.

This router is intentionally thin: it only wires HTTP requests to the Ollama
service. The pieces it depends on live in their own modules so each file has
a single responsibility:

    app/config.py          — environment configuration (OLLAMA_BASE_URL, OLLAMA_MODEL)
    app/schemas/chat.py    — Pydantic request/response models
    app/services/ollama.py — HTTP client logic for talking to Ollama

Endpoints:
    POST /chat   — Send a list of messages and get a single assistant reply back.
