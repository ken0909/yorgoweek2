"""
Task router — defines all API endpoints for managing tasks.

This is the core of the application. It defines the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
operations for tasks, plus a search endpoint. Each function handles a specific type of
HTTP request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to a specific URL path.

How it works:
    - This file uses an APIRouter (like a mini FastAPI app) to group related endpoints
    - The router is registered in main.py with app.include_router()
    - All endpoints here are prefixed with "/tasks" (set in the router configuration)
    - Tasks are stored in an in-memory list (they reset when the server restarts)

Endpoints defined here:
    GET    /tasks            — List all tasks
    POST   /tasks            — Create a new task
    GET    /tasks/{task_id}  — Get a specific task by ID
    GET    /tasks/search/    — Search tasks by keyword
    PUT    /tasks/{task_id}  — Update a task
    DELETE /tasks/{task_id}  — Delete a task
